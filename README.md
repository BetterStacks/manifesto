# THE STACKS MANIFESTO  

---  

### **THE PROBLEM**  
You're drowning. Not in water, but in **noise.**  
Your ideas? Scattered. Your knowledge? Buried.  
Your saved links? **Lost in the void of “I’ll check it later.”**  

Every day, you consume more than your mind can handle.  
Notion wants you to build a system. Google Drive wants you to **dig.**  
AI tools want to **"assist"**—but they don’t even know you.  

⚡ **You don’t need another workspace. You need a weapon.**  
⚡ **You don’t need another system. You need a memory that works for you.**  
⚡ **You don’t need to search. You need to know. Instantly.**  

You don’t have time to **sort.** You have time to **win.**

### **THE STACKS REVOLUTION**  
📌 **Capture. Recall. Apply.** That’s the cycle of progress. Stacks runs it for you.  

🚀 **It’s built for the fast.**  
- No more tagging, labeling, organizing.  
- No more “systems” to maintain.  
- No more “Where did I save that?”  

🔥 **It’s built for action.**  
- Your knowledge **served to you before you even need it.**  
- **Context-rich connections.** Instagram Reel + Airbnb stay + Bookmarked tweet? Stacks sees the link, even when you don’t.  
- **Your personal AI, trained on YOU.** Not the internet. Not random data. Just *your* mind—amplified.  

🛡 **It’s built for YOU.**  
- Your **preferences.** Your **data.** Your **control.**  
- AI that’s not **owned by Big Tech.**  
- An **infrastructure of intention.**

### **WHO STACKS?**  
🚀 **The ones who think fast and act faster.**  
- The ones **who don’t waste time building “systems.”**  
- The ones **who don’t organize—they execute.**  
- The ones **who don’t remember—they just know.**  

The **builders.** The **doers.** The **obsessed.**

### **THE RALLYING CRY**  
⚡ **STACK OR BE STACKED.**  

This isn’t another note-taking app.  
This isn’t another productivity tool.  

This is **your mind, on overdrive.**  
And if you’re still manually organizing files, links, and notes?  

You’re already **losing.**
